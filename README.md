# NEURONexercises
 Repository of exercises using the NEURON simulator

For details of the exercises and how to run them, please see the PDF file, NEURON-exercises-basic.pdf. Short example answers to the accompanying questions in each exercise are available in NEURON-exercises-basic-ans.pdf. 

To provide further background information, there is also a PDF of a set of lecture slides (BNNI_CNintro_2021.pdf) introducing the basics of computational neuroscience, as presented at the Baltic-Nordic Neuroinformatics Summer School in September 2021. These slides are largely based on the book, "Principles of Computational Modelling in Neuroscience" (CUP, 2011; 2nd Edition due 2023).

The exercise code should run in all recent releases of the NEURON simulation software on any supported platform (latest test was September 2021 in NEURON 8 under Windows 10). Underlying code is written in hoc and NMODL, with the user interface using Interviews.

You will need to clone this repository (or download a ZIP file) to the machine on which you have installed NEURON, and then appropriately compile .mod files in some of the Exercises subdirectories, as per the instructions in NEURON-exercises-basic.pdf.

Have fun!
